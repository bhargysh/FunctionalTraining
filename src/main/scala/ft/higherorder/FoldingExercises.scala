/**
  * DO NOT ATTEMPT these exercises until you've completed the recursion ones.

  * foldLeft will reduce a list of A's down to a B. It takes an initial value of type B
  * and a list of A's.  It also takes a function which takes the accumulated value of type B
  * and the next value in the list (of type A) and returns a value which will be feed back into
  * the accumulator of the next call.
  *
  * As the name suggests it processes the list from left to right.
  *
  * Have a close look at your implementations from the RecursionExercises.  Which parts could you
  * pull out to a function to make them all common? Your implementation will be very close to
  * foldLeft.
  *
  * Good luck!
